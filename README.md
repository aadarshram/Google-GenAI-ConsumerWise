# ConsumerWise

## Description
ConsumerWise, a GenAI powered nutrient analysis tool/chatbot that allows users to validate their food choices through informed decisions. The implementation involves an end-to-end chatbot , supported with Context Awareness and API based techniques. We attempt to allow users to scan their food products and obtain some form of nutritional insight through both visual aids as well as in conversation with our NutriBot.

## Features
- User Readability: The main attempt is to provide nutritional information in a concise manner that is user readable ,
further assisted by visual aids such as pie-charts and histograms. This is to give the user a starting point.

- Personalisation: This involves Context Awareness , answering user-level queries based of the information uploaded by
them. It attempts to interlink the current analysis with these queries for personalised answers.

- Data Interpretation and Visualization: Interpreting extracted data and provide insights, such as analyzing nutritional
content or suggesting diet alternatives, and visualizing the data to enhance user comprehension.

- Integration with User Data: Connecting nutritional recommendations with user habits (e.g., current exercise routine,
stress level) for a holistic health approach.
